You are given two sentences, each starting with an index:
0 {sentence1}
1 {sentence2}

Your task is to determine which sentence better reflects common sense. You must choose only one option, either 0 or 1 â€” no ties, no explanations.

Your final response must consist of only the number "0" or "1" as the last character in your reply.
